There are several git commands which I will use quite frequently in this class and beyond as a software developer. One such command is 'git create'. This command allows me to create a new repository. 'git add' adds a file to staging, while 'git commit' commits that file. 'git push' will push the local commits to the remote repo. 'git status' tells you what is going on in your local git repo. 'git pull' gets changes from the remote server, and 'git merge' allows you to merge the changes made in one branch into your current branch.
